>> [!CHECK]- ### use the **Global Note Template** to organise your notes
>> - access the GNT via hotkeys (`alt + F` or `alt + shift + F` if not in an active note) or via the tab bar commander buttons.
>> - create and organise notes by `type` (recipe, project, book, film, person notes...)
>
>> [!CHECK]- ### the **vault folder structure** is simple and flat
>> - `10 Sources` : like literature notes or clippings 
>> - `20 My` : one's own personal space for reflective writing, journals, home and people.
>> - `30 Notes` : one's own notes
>> - `40 projects` : a space for specific projects
>> - `00 Meta` : vault instructions, explore your vault using datascopes, attachments, and plugin dependencies (e.g. templates etc)
>
>> [!CHECK]- ### use **Quickadd** to perform note actions and navigate 
>> - trigger Quickadd using  the hotkey `alt + shift + Q`, or via the commander buttons in the top right of the tab bar.

>> - **navigate the vault** (periodic notes, home, tasks, invoke the global note template)

>> [!CHECK]- ### maintain your journal in structured **periodic notes**
